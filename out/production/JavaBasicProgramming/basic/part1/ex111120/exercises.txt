111. Write a Java program to add two numbers without using any arithmetic operators.
Given x = 10 and y = 12; result = 22

112. Write a Java program to compute the number of trailing zeros in a factorial.
7! = 5040, therefore the output should be 1

113. Write a Java program to merge two given sorted array of integers and create a new sorted array.
array1 = [1,2,3,4]
array2 = [2,5,7, 8]
result = [1,2,2,3,4,5,7,8]

114. Write a Java program to given a string and an offset, rotate string by offset (rotate from left to right).

Input a positive integer: 151
Is 151 is a palindrome number?
true

116. Write a Java program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and print "Buzz" for the multiples of five. When number is divided by both three and five, print "fizz buzz".
