 141. Write a Java program to check if a given string has all unique characters.
Sample Output: Original String : xyyz
String has all unique characters: false

142. Write a Java program to check if two given strings are anagrams or not.
According to Wikipedia "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram, or the word binary into brainy."
Sample Output: String-1 : wxyz
String-2 : zyxw
Check if two given strings are anagrams or not?: true

The length of the new array is: 4

145. Write a Java program to remove the nth element from the end of a given list.
Sample Output:
Original node:
1 2 3 4 5
After removing 2nd element from end:
