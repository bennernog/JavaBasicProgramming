121. Write a Java program to reverse a given linked list.
Example: For linked list 20->40->60->80, the reversed linked list is 80->60->40->20 

122. Write a Java program to find a contiguous subarray with largest sum from a given array of integers.
Note: In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a
one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values
−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.
The subarray should contain one integer at least. 

123. Write a Java program to find the subarray with smallest sum from a given array of integers.

124. Write a Java program to find the index of a value in a sorted array. If the value does not find
return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
Example:
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 5(target) -> 3(index)
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 0(target) -> 0(index)
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 7(target) -> 5(index)

125. Write a Java program to get the preorder traversal of its nodes' values of a given a binary tree.
Example:
    10
   / \
  20   30
 / \
40   50
Expected output: 10 20 40 50 30
126. Write a Java program to get the inorder traversal of its nodes' values of a given a binary tree.
    10
   / \
  20   30
 / \
40   50
Example:{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output: 40 20 50 10 30
127. Write a Java program to get the Postorder traversal of its nodes' values of a given a binary tree.
    10
   / \
  20   30
 / \
40   50
128.Write a Java program to calculate the median of a given unsorted array of integers.
Example: {10,2,38,23,38,23,21}
Output: 23

129. Write a Java program to find a number that appears only once in a given array of integers, all numbers occur twice.
Source Array : [10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 30, 50] 50 appears only once

130. Write a Java program to find the maximum depth of a given a binary tree.
Sample Output: The Maximum depth of the binary tree is: 3
