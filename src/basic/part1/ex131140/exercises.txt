131. Write a Java program to find the new length of a given sorted array where each element appear only once
(remove the duplicates ).
Original array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7] The length of the original array is: 11 After removing duplicates,
the new length of the array is: 7

132. Write a Java program to find the new length of a given sorted array where duplicate elements appeared at most twice.
Original array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7]
The length of the original array is: 13
After removing duplicates, the new length of the array is: 10

133. Write a Java program to find a path from top left to bottom in right direction which minimizes the sum of all
numbers along its path.
Note: Move either down or right at any point in time.
Sample Output: Sum of all numbers along its path: 13

134. Write a Java program to find the distinct ways you can climb to the top (n steps to reach to the top) of stairs.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
Example: n = 5
a) 1+1+1+1+1 = 5 b) 1+1+1+2 = 5 c) 1+2+2 = 5 d) 2+2+1 = 5 e) 2+1+1+1 = 5 f) 2+1+2 = 5 g) 1+2+1+1 = 5 h) 1+1+2+1 = 5
Sample Output: Distinct ways can you climb to the top: 8

135. Write a Java program to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
Original List with duplicate elements:
12->12->13->14->15->15->16->17->17
After removing duplicates from the said list:
12->13->14->15->16->17

136. Write a Java program to find possible unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of a given grid (m x n).
Note: You can move either down or right at any point in time.
Sample Output: Unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of the said grid: 3

137. Write a Java program to find possible unique paths considering some obstacles, from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of a given grid (m x n).
Note: You can move either down or right at any point in time and an obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
Sample grid:
int[][] obstacle_Grid ={
{0, 0, 0},
{0, 1, 0},
{0, 0, 0},
};
Sample Output: Unique paths from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of the said grid (considering some obstacles): 2

138. Write a Java program to find all of the longest word in a given dictionary.
Example-1:
{
"cat",
"flag",
"green",
"country",
"w3resource"
}
Result: "w3resource"
Example-2:
{
"cat",
"dog",
"red",
"is",
"am"
}
Result: "cat", "dog", "red"

139. Write a Java program to get the index of the first number and the last number of a subarray where the sum of numbers is zero from a given array of integers.
Original Array : [1, 2, 3, -6, 5, 4]
Index of the subarray of the said array where the sum of numbers is zero: [0, 3]

140. Write a Java program to merge all overlapping Intervals from a given a collection of intervals.
Sample Output: 1 6
8 10
15 20
